Explain how youll be able to print them.  T

For the switch cut off the little ends and slide them in into the little wings on the second layer then tilt it in into the hole and try to place them properly on the little numbs on the case. Should be really easy to do. 

i suggest to place BMI60 and the D1 on the first layer and get all the curret sizes for the wiring length so it can be all nice and tighty!! the case does have a little wiggle room if your new to soldering but just take your time with it and have fun!! As well place the battery first and leave it there when you start to solder the TP

i used this video as refecrse on how to solder it
