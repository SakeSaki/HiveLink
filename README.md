Everything is meant to be very tight so dont worry about going too rough with it. no body likes it gentle anywa- PFFFFFFFTT anyways.

To print and assemble the HiveLink tracker case, follow these simple steps:

1. Tilt the switch withe the switch holder into the hole and ensure it is properly placed with the tray and case.

2. For assembly: Place the battery first then the BMI60 make sure the holes go to the right, D1 mini, and TP on the tray(TP first then the D1 mini) and adjust the wiring length accordingly. Ensure a tidy and secure fit. Then start soldering.

3. Refer to this [soldering tutorial video](https://youtu.be/hGc3ey2mqJU) by Tehrasha Darkon for guidance on soldering the TP4056. While not necessary, it can help ensure a neat and secure connection.

4. Flip all the tops of the case upside down for better printing and it looks better

5. for the ph jst just tilt it and put it and as well for its meant to stay in and not be able to get out as well for the switch.



Assembly is straightforward, but there are a few considerations to keep in mind. Due to variations in printer tolerances, some light sanding of the tray's sides may be necessary for a perfect fit. However, it is designed to snap into place snugly. To ensure optimal wire management, I recommend keeping the wires short. It's best to solder components outside of the case and use the case/tray as a reference for determining wire length.

Remember to take your time and have fun with the process! Enjoy printing and assembling your HiveLink trackers!

Dont wanna waste time building it yourself? or printing the cases? you can buy them both from me!! [Cases and Trackers](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1EOP30RMt38Rm0TsUZrYEHRzKEQSfK_5F34ZGGU3et4U/edit)
