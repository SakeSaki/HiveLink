**Printer:** Ender 3 S1
**Material:** PLA Bambu
**Layer Height:** 0.12 - 0.2
**Walls:** 3-5
**Infill:** 20%
**Supports:** Optional (i printed them with supports...helps a bit)
**Birms:** use it since the parts have sarp corners.

To print and assemble the HiveLink tracker case, follow these simple steps:

1. Cut off the little ends of the switch and slide them into the wings on the second layer. Tilt the switch into the hole and ensure it is properly placed on the small numbs on the case.

2. For assembly, place the BMI60 and D1 on the first layer and adjust the wiring length accordingly. Ensure a tidy and secure fit. Place the battery first and keep it in place while soldering the TP.

3. Refer to this [soldering tutorial video](https://youtu.be/hGc3ey2mqJU) for guidance on soldering the TP4056. While not necessary, it can help ensure a neat and secure connection.

4. Flip all the tops of the case upside down for better printing and it looks better

5. for the ph jst port put it in, on  a angle and as well for its meant to stay in and not be able to get out as well for the switch.



Assembly is straightforward, but there are a few considerations to keep in mind. Due to variations in printer tolerances, some light sanding of the tray's sides may be necessary for a perfect fit. However, it is designed to snap into place snugly. To ensure optimal wire management, I recommend keeping the wires short. It's best to solder components outside of the case and use the case/tray as a reference for determining wire length.

Remember to take your time and have fun with the process! Enjoy printing and assembling your HiveLink trackers!

Dont wanna waste time building it yourself? or printing the cases? you can buy them both from me!! [Cases and Trackers](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1EOP30RMt38Rm0TsUZrYEHRzKEQSfK_5F34ZGGU3et4U/edit)
